  unarchive:
      src:  /tmp/terraform_{{ terraform_version }}_{{ os }}_{{ arch }}.zip
      dest: /usr/local/bin # required. Remote absolute path where the archive should be unpacked.
      remote_src: yes # not required. Set to C(yes) to indicate the archived file is already on the remote system and not local to the Ansible controller.,This option is mutually exclusive with C(copy).
      mode: 0755 # not required. Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.  Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results. As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).
